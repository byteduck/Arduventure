# Arduventure
A game that plays on an Arduino Mega 2560 using no external libraries other than the standard AVR/Arduino ones.
Using my [Arduino-VGA](https://github.com/byteduck/Arduino-VGA) code, I decided to make a little Atari 2600 "Adventure" -esque game.
Check [Arduventure.ino](Arduventure.ino) and [Arduventure.h](Arduventure.h) for which pins to hook everything to.
